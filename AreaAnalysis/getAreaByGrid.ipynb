    "### Get Developable Area by Grid\n",
    "This notebook is the first notebook in the resourceAssessment workflow. In this notebook we take two file geodatabases (1) **resourceAssessment.gdb**, contains 4 polygon feature classes representing suitable areas for industrial wind and solar development in the CONUS according to two different models (WU, ZRM) (2) **grids.gdb** contains fishnet polygons derived from the geometries of two different atmospheric analysis datasets (cesm2, era5). For each developable area dataset, for each grid geometry, we calculate the total developable area per grid cell, and the percent developable area per grid cell. Results are saved to **resourceAssessementResults.gdb**. "
