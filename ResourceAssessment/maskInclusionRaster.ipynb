    "### Mask Inclusion Raster\n",
    "In this notebook, we mask our 'Technical Inclusion' layer with (1) the 'Environmental Exclusion' layer and (2) the 'Techhnical Exclusion' layer to generate our InclusionArea_Solar_SL1_ZRM.tif and InclusionArea_Wind_SL1_ZRM.tif rasters. We then extract the output using Tiger/Line 2018 CONUS boundaries, and convert the raster datasets to vector feature classes, and dissolve the feature classes. \n",

    "**Note:** The current version requires the user to manually review and delete coastal waters polygons before running the dissolve_feature_class() function (for most applications). This will be corrected in future versions.  "
